## Abstract

Currently [`FunctionLiteral`](https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#FunctionLiteral)s that capture their outer context *(i.e. closures/delegates)* require an allocation and the garbage collector. This can incur unnecessary performance degradation and disallows the use of `FunctionLiteral`s *(most notably lambdas)* in `@nogc` code.

This paper proposes a new `ValueFunctionLiteral` expression family that produces closures with value semantics. The user explicitly specifies what variables from the outer scope must be "captured" and how. `ValueFunctionLiteral` would be just syntactic sugar for [structs](https://dlang.org/spec/struct.html).

## Description

TODO:

* Detailed technical description of the new semantics.
* Language grammar changes (per https://dlang.org/spec/grammar.html).
* Similarity/differences with C++.
* Capture modes/syntax.
* Just syntactic sugar for struct generation.
* Comparison vs library solutions.

### Rationale

TODO:

State a short motivation about the importance and benefits of the proposed
change.  An existing, well-known issue or a use case for an existing projects
can greatly increase the chances of the DIP being understood and carefully
evaluated.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

This paper proposes a pure language extension: no existing code will become invalid.

### Examples

#### Captureless lambda

```d
void foo() @nogc
{
    auto l = []() => writeln("hello!");
}
```

...would roughly expand to:

```d
void foo() @nogc
{
    struct anonymous_l
    {
        auto opCall() { writeln("hello!"); }
    }

    anonymous_l l;
}
```

#### Capture by value lambda

```d
void foo() @nogc
{
    int i = 10;
    auto l = [i]() => writeln(i);
}
```

...would roughly expand to:

```d
void foo() @nogc
{
    struct anonymous_l
    {
        int _i;
        this(int i) { _i = i; }
        auto opCall() { writeln("hello!"); }
    }

    int i = 10;
    anonymous_l l(i);
}
```

#### Capture by reference lambda

```d
void foo() @nogc
{
    int i = 10;
    auto l = [ref i]() => writeln(i);
}
```

...would roughly expand to:

```d
void foo() @nogc
{
    struct anonymous_l
    {
        ref int _i;
        this(ref int i) { _i = i; }
        auto opCall() { writeln("hello!"); }
    }

    int i = 10;
    anonymous_l l(i);
}
```
